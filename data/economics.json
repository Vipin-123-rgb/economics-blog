    "summary": "The Government of India, through the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), has announced a comprehensive revision of the base years for key macroeconomic indicators—Consumer Price Index (CPI), Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and Index of Industrial Production (IIP). This reform aims to improve the accuracy, relevance, and international comparability of India’s economic data, which is critical for effective monetary and fiscal policymaking.",
    "content": "Economic policymaking relies fundamentally on the quality of data. In India, key macroeconomic indicators such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Index of Industrial Production (IIP) guide decisions related to monetary policy, fiscal management and development planning. Recognising the structural transformation of the Indian economy over the last decade, the Government of India, through the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), has announced a comprehensive revision of the base years for these indicators, as officially communicated via the Press Information Bureau (PIB).\n\nA base year serves as a reference period against which changes in economic variables are measured. For GDP, it determines sectoral weights that reflect the structure of the economy. For CPI, it defines the consumption basket used to measure inflation. For IIP, it represents the industrial composition against which production growth is assessed. India’s existing base years—2011–12 for GDP and IIP, and 2012 for CPI—no longer fully capture changes such as digitalisation, expansion of services, formalisation of economic activity, and shifts in household consumption patterns.\n\nAccording to the official PIB note, MoSPI has initiated a coordinated exercise to revise the base years of CPI, GDP and IIP, with a plan to update them every three to five years going forward. This approach aligns India’s statistical practices with international standards recommended by institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the United Nations. The revision will update sectoral and product weights, expand coverage of goods and services, and incorporate improved data sources and methodologies.\n\nThe revision of base years does not alter the underlying economy; rather, it improves how the economy is measured. Updated CPI weights may change inflation dynamics, especially as the relative importance of food declines and services gain prominence. This has direct implications for the Reserve Bank of India’s inflation-targeting framework. Similarly, revised GDP estimates will provide a more accurate picture of sectoral contributions to growth, while an updated IIP will better reflect contemporary industrial activity.\n\nFrom a policy perspective, improved data quality strengthens evidence-based decision-making. For monetary policy, a more representative CPI enhances inflation assessment and policy credibility. For fiscal policy, revised GDP figures improve the interpretation of deficit and debt ratios. At the same time, transparent communication during the transition phase will be essential to avoid confusion arising from revisions in historical data.\n\nOverall, the revision of base years for CPI, GDP and IIP represents a necessary and forward-looking reform. By strengthening the statistical foundation of economic governance, India is better positioned to design effective policies in a rapidly evolving economic environment.",
