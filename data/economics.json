    "summary": "India has announced a comprehensive revision of base years for CPI, GDP and IIP to improve accuracy, relevance and international comparability of economic data.",
    "content": "India has initiated a comprehensive revision of the base years used for key macroeconomic indicators—GDP, CPI and IIP—through the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), as officially released by the Press Information Bureau (PIB).\n\nA base year acts as a reference point for measuring economic growth, inflation and industrial performance. India’s current base years (GDP: 2011–12, CPI: 2012, IIP: 2011–12) no longer fully capture structural changes such as digitalisation, services expansion and changing consumption patterns.\n\nThe revised base years will update sectoral weights, expand coverage of goods and services, and align India’s statistical practices with international standards. This will improve data accuracy, policy formulation and global credibility.\n\nFor monetary policy, an updated CPI will provide a more realistic inflation picture, aiding the RBI’s decision-making. For fiscal policy, revised GDP and IIP data will improve planning and resource allocation.\n\nWhile the transition may cause short-term confusion due to revised historical numbers, transparent communication will be key. Overall, this reform strengthens India’s economic data framework and supports evidence-based policymaking."
