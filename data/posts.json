    "summary": "The Government of India has announced a revision of the base years for CPI, GDP and IIP to better reflect structural changes such as digitalisation, shifting consumption patterns and expansion of the services sector. The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation stated that updated sectoral weights and expanded coverage will improve accuracy and international comparability of economic data. Revised CPI data will strengthen inflation measurement for RBI’s monetary policy, while updated GDP and IIP series will improve fiscal planning and industrial policy design. Although historical data may be revised, the reform enhances transparency and credibility of India’s statistical framework.",

    "summary": "IMF analysis suggests that global inflation has moderated from its post-pandemic peak due to easing supply constraints and tighter monetary policy. However, inflation remains above target in many economies because of persistent services inflation and geopolitical risks. For India, global disinflation provides some relief through stabilising commodity prices, but external shocks and financial tightening risks remain. The IMF stresses the need for credible monetary policy, fiscal discipline and structural reforms to sustain growth while maintaining price stability.",
